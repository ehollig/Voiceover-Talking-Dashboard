# Voiceover-Talking-Dashboard
Useful scripts for Voiceover to retrieve information about Mac.

## What is it?

This is a collection of Voiceover scripts collected from around the web and a few I have created myself.

## How to set up?

1. First, download the files and extract them to a folder on your Mac
2. Turn on the "Allow VoiceOver to be controlled with AppleScript" checkbox.
* This can be found in the VoiceOver Utility, accessed by pressing Control+Option+F8 or Control+Option+FN+F8 under General
* The scripts can work without this enabled. Enabling this option will allow for announcements to utilize Voiceover's prefered voice and speach rate.
2. Navigate to Commanders in the Utility Categories list
3. Enable the Keyboard tab
4. Enable the "Enable Keyboard Commander" checkbox
5. In the Keyboard Commander table, assign a key to perform the action "Run AppleScript Script"
* Example: t, Run AppleScript Script:  Time and Date
* By default, right option + t would run the Time and Date script
6. Assign a key to other scripts you would like to run
